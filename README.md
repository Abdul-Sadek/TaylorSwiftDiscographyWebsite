# TaylorSwiftDiscographyWebsite
This is a website that showcases Taylor Swift's musical catalog (i.e. discography) throughout the years, and has links to the relevant Wikipedia pages about each album's commercial success.
I'm a huge swiftie, and I thought I'd make something to show it. Whenever I'm bored of coding in C++, I work on this silly website on my own.
